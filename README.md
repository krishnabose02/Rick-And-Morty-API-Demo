# The Rickact Native DeMortyanstration

### A Rick And Morty Handbook built with TypeScript and React Native.

Wubba lubba dub dub people of C-137!

Are you trying to learn React Native the proper way and is TypeScript holding you back?
Say no more, Morty to the rescue here.
This project brings together 3 things that you love.

1. React Native
2. TypeScript
3. And of course Rick and Morty.

Data is fetched from [The Rick and Morty API](www.rickandmortyapi.com), its really nice, check it out once.
You can use both graphQL and REST API for querying its data, but since I'm a noob-noob in GraphQL, I'll just stick to their REST API version.

This project plans to demo the basics of React native written with typescript and tries to address the pain points that new learners are facing (according to what people ask me).

So, I shall be trying to address all of them eventually
starting with stuff like

1. Proper Navigation setup with typescript types
2. Use of navigation router with strongly typed parameters
3. Use of states with types
4. Functional components and hooks
5. Fetching data from REST API with Axios (and type the data with TypeScript)

... and a lot more to come.

If I ever feel like, (or people ask me to) I shall be writing dedicated articles and make youtube videos explaining basic and advanced stuff related to TS and RN (with a lot of energy, dedication, passion and ofc sarcasm), so lets see where it goes.

So, feel free to fork and make your own Rick and Morty Handbook and tinker with the designs and add functionality. Or if you like, send a PR, I'll be happy to take it forward.

PS: If you want to ask something to me, drop a mail to krishna.bose02@gmail.com or ping me up on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/krishnabose).

PPS: IDK how it would turn out, but alternately you can raise an issue if you want me to highlight any RN feature on this demo, I'll try to figure something out.
